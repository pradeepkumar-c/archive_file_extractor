# Interview Task: Archive File Extractor Service

## Overview
Build an HTTP service, packaged as a Docker container, that accepts archive files and a file pattern, searches for matching files — including inside nested archives — and stores the results in a database table.
Estimated time: 2 hours
Submission: Git repository with source code, Dockerfile, README, and tests.

## The Task
Implement a service that exposes an HTTP API. Given a zip archive and a file pattern, the service finds every file inside the archive whose path matches the pattern, persists the results to a database, and exposes the results via API.

## Configuration
The service is configured via environment variables (or a config file):
- `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_TABLE`
- `CONCURRENCY` — number of parallel workers (optional, with a sensible default)
- `PORT` — HTTP port to listen on

## Suggested API

- `POST /extractions` — Submit a new extraction job.
	- Accepts the archive as multipart/form-data upload or a URL/path reference — your choice, justify in the README
	- Body parameters: `pattern` (glob, required)
	- Response: `202 Accepted` with a `job_id`
- `GET /extractions/{job_id}` — Get job status (pending / running / completed / failed) and summary (number of matches, error if any).
- `GET /extractions/{job_id}/results` — List matched files for a job, with pagination.
- `GET /health` — Liveness/readiness endpoint.

You may adjust the API shape — what matters is that the service is usable, jobs can be tracked, and results retrieved.

## Example usage

Start the service
```sh
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
-e DB_HOST=db.example.com -e DB_PORT=5432 \
-e DB_NAME=extractor -e DB_USER=user -e DB_PASSWORD=*** \
-e DB_TABLE=extracted_files \
file-extractor-service
```

Submit a job
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/extractions \
-F "archive=@./input.zip" \
-F "pattern=**/*.json"
```

Check status
```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/extractions/<job_id>
```

Get results
```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/extractions/<job_id>/results
```

## Requirements

1. Nested archives

Archives may contain other archives (zip, tar, tar.gz, etc.) at any nesting level. The service must recursively descend into all of them and continue matching the pattern. Assume nesting can be arbitrarily deep; enforce a safety limit of your choice.

2. Concurrency

The service should leverage concurrency to reduce processing time — for example, processing multiple nested archives in parallel, or scanning entries within an archive in parallel. It should also be able to handle multiple extraction jobs concurrently. Be mindful of:
- Race conditions on shared state
- Connection pooling / safe DB writes
- Cleanup of temporary files
- Bounded resource usage (don't spawn unlimited goroutines/threads)

3. Asynchronous job processing

Submitting a job should not block the HTTP request until extraction finishes. The job runs in the background and progress is queryable via the status endpoint. The choice of in-process worker pool, queue, or another mechanism is yours — justify it in the README.

4. Database storage

For every matching file, insert a row into the target table. You may design the schema, but it must capture at minimum:
- Job ID (link to the extraction job)
- The full path to the file, including the nesting chain (e.g. outer.zip/inner.tar.gz/data/file.json)
- File name and size
- Nesting depth
- Timestamp of extraction
- Source archive name

You should also store the jobs themselves (id, status, submitted_at, completed_at, error, etc.). Include a setup script (DDL / migration) for creating the tables.

5. Containerization

The service must run as a Docker container. The image should be minimal and require no external setup beyond docker run (plus a reachable database). A docker-compose.yml that brings up the service together with a database is a nice touch.

## Non-Functional Expectations

- Clear error handling: corrupt archives, unsupported formats, DB failures, invalid input — informative responses, appropriate HTTP status codes, no resource leaks
- Structured logging with job IDs for traceability
- Reasonable memory usage on large archives (prefer streaming over loading into memory)
- Temporary files cleaned up, including on failure
- Graceful shutdown: in-flight jobs should be handled sensibly when the service is stopped

## Deliverables

1. Python
2. Dockerfile
3. Flask
4. README.md with build & run instructions, API documentation, examples, and any assumptions you made
5. Tests — unit tests, plus at least one integration test exercising the full flow against a sample archive with nested archives

## Submission

Please send us a link to a Git repository (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) containing your solution. In your README, include:
- How to build and run the service
- How to exercise it against a sample archive (feel free to include one in the repo)
- Any assumptions or shortcuts you made and what you would do differently with more time

Good luck - we're looking forward to seeing your solution and discussing it with you.
